# Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
 This document was designed for The Gaming Room, creators of a game application. The software they wish to design is a web-based game application capable of being hosted on multiple platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
 I believe that I did well in developing this entire document. I took great care in researching the needs of the software and the client. Applying the knowledge I have learned about operating systems and their unique
 characteristics, particularly memory management and the compatibility of different systems, I recommended a design that I thought best fit the client budget and software needs.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
 The design document was crucial in knowing how the code was to be structured even before typing a single line. The design document was instrumental in preventing a lot of overhead in coding by making use of class objects     that inherit variables and methods from each other, and provided an overall framework which to follow.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
 I felt like the table used to document the characteristics and weaknesses of each operating platform was a hindrance and did not allow for a full analysis of each platform. Space within the table was limited. I would have    improved the document by removing the table entirely to allow for a full accounting of each platforms unique characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses at hosting a multi-platform web-based game.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
 The software design was built for a multi-platform web-based game. The user of said game would want it to be responsive, so they don't have to wait long for their turn, be easy to use, and be able to save their progress so   that they may come back to play at any time. All of these needs point to a software design that both manages persistent memory well, and also has the capability to communicate across devices and networks quickly. The         user's needs are important because the user is also ultimately a customer.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I essentially utilized the principle of object-oriented design which breaks larger, more complex software into more manageable and scaleable components. This technique works by modeling real world objects with attributes     and methods, and it is a common software design approach that I would use again.
